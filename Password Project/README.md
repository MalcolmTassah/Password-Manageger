# Password Manager - C# Desktop App

This project is a password manager my team and I built for our Data Structures course. It’s a simple desktop app made with Windows Forms in C#. The goal was to securely store user passwords using AES encryption and save them in a SQL database.

## Features
- User login and authentication
- AES encryption for secure password storage
- Passwords are stored in a connected SQL database
- Clean Windows Forms interface
- Secure key handling (nothing hardcoded or exposed)

## Tools & Technologies
- C#
- Windows Forms
- SQL Server
- Visual Studio

## How to Run It
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3. Set up a local SQL database and update the connection string in the code.
4. Build and run the app.

## Notes
- This was a team project. I focused on the encryption/decryption and the login system.
- Feel free to use the code as a learning reference, but don’t use real passwords when testing it.

## Why We Built It
We wanted to build something useful and learn more about encryption, databases, and desktop development along the way.
